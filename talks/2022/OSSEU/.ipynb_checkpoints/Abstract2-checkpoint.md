Open source has become the defining way of developing software. But what’s next after releasing the code? Building an infrastructure for a project is hard. What CI/CD pipelines should I use, how to deploy - can I integrate with other services, where are my users? The Operate First community cloud is an environment for developing and operating Cloud Native software and a community of developers, DevOps, and SREs to learn from each other. Built on git-ops and open-source principles with open deployments and operational knowledge, the community provides a solid foundation for your project, so that you can focus on your solution. When the Open Source Climate initiative started out building an open data science platform that aggregates open climate data sets, they required an environment that supports complex data ingestion, processing, and quality management. You will learn how the team took advantage of the Operate First community-supported infrastructure, resolving foundational problems quickly and freeing time to work on the climate and data science problems. We’ll take you on a ride through cloud operations, by re-visiting the journey of the OS Climate community, explaining how your project or community can also become part of a fully open source community cloud.
