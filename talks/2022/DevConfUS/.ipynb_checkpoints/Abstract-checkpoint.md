Want to learn how to accelerate your development of AI applications on the hybrid cloud? In this workshop, we introduce you to Operate First, an open cloud platform that provides cloud services and applications that support data scientists. We will walk you through the process of building a simple AIOps tool from scratch on the Operate First cloud and learn how to move your AI workloads to the cloud by implementing an end-to-end ML tool.

We start by learning how to collect data from an open CI/CD data source, use Jupyterlab and its extensions to manage dependencies, and run jupyter notebooks. We will learn how to perform automated, repeatable experiments using Elyra and Kubeflow Pipelines, create and deploy machine learning modes on OpenShift using Seldon and visualize results on a Superset dashboard.

By the end of this workshop, you will have an idea of how to build a simple AIOps tool on the cloud that can support your CI/CD processes. You will learn how to get started with, build data science tools, or onboard your existing projects on the Operate First cloud.
