Open source ecosystems are constantly expanding, with new communities growing and evolving every day. Staying informed about these new emerging projects, communities, and user groups can be beneficial for business leaders, Open Source Program Offices and individual contributors who want to invest in and support these initiatives and discover exciting projects. This talk showcases how graph theory techniques and algorithms can be used to depict open source communities and uncover the relationships between them. Through the Augur OSS project, we collect data for project repositories and their shared contributors which we then represent as nodes and edges in a graph. We demonstrate the use of centrality algorithms such as PageRank and Betweenness centrality to identify significant project communities in connection to already well established projects. By examining structures of these graphs visually, we gain an understanding of how well connected projects are and discover key user groups, track the growth of new communities and explore new projects. Attendees walk away learning how to visualize open source ecosystems and the importance of graphical techniques in simplifying complex systems and networks.
