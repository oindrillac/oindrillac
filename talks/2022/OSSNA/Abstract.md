How do you assess and track the health of your project in an open source, data-driven way? Github repositories reveal crucial information about the project e.g. velocity, blockers, community health, etc. which can ultimately help guide the development of the project. In this talk, we show how we can get deeper insights into the software development process by creating a set of open source data science workflows that collect data about a repo’s PR’s, analyze them, and visualize key metrics on a dashboard. We also show how to build and deploy ML models that can be used to supplement the project development process. Specifically, we show how we can create these dashboards and services on an open source community cloud where data scientists get an environment for solving data science challenges without setting up the infrastructure and services. This also provides an environment where operations are open source, so that data scientists have full visibility into the platform and their workloads every step of the way. By the end of this talk, attendees would have learned how to use the set of ML tools to derive key metrics from their Github repos and use the open source tools for creating reproducible notebooks, models as services, building automated pipelines and dashboards.
