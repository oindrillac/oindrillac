Open source ecosystems are constantly expanding, with new communities growing and evolving every day. Tracking emerging projects, communities, and user groups is beneficial for business leaders, OSPOs and individual contributors who want to invest in, support and discover exciting projects.

This talk showcases how graph theory techniques and algorithms can be used to depict open source communities and uncover the relationships between them. Through the Augur OSS project, we collect data for various GitHub projects and represent them as a graphical network. We demonstrate the use of centrality algorithms such as PageRank and Betweenness centrality to identify significant project communities in connection to well established projects.

By examining the graphs, we can discover key user groups and track the growth of new communities. Attendees walk away learning how to visualize open source ecosystems and the importance of graphical techniques in simplifying complex systems and networks.
